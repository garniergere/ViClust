IN Rscript folder:

ClusterSequenomPlots.Filter1.hclust.R can be run in command line under the Win dos prompt or under linux
   (see examples of command lines at start of the program)

ClusterSequenomPlots.Filter1.hclust.ReditorVer.R is an R editor version

Files in the Rscript/Galaxy.files subfolder contains the Galaxy version of the R program and the xml file for the main explanation page of the Galaxy version.

ViClust.2.Matrix.R is a script formatting result files from ViClust R scripts above to a easier matrix genotype format. Code given uses the 
res.with.hclust.txt example in Example.files/resfile subfolder and gives different genotype files in Example.files/output.from.ViClust.2.Matrix
subfolder 

IN Examples.files folder:

Subfolder Examples.files/Sequenom.plots contains examples of sequenom output plots. Here a subset list of SNP1 to SNP5 from the
ViClust.example.xml raw data file is used.

The SNPs list example is called SNPlist.example.txt and is an argument/option when running the program (see R scripts for more details)

subfolder Examples.files/Filter1.plots contains the SNP plots after an eventual additional filter on signal magnitude has been applied from 
the original Sequenom results

Folder Examples.files/Hclust.plots contains the plots of the clustering performed after applying the Hierarchical Clustering method with the
Ward algorithm
You can note the difference between the proposed clustering in genotype classes with the Hclust method compared to the Sequenom method.

Subfolder Examples.files/resfile contains result files described in the main readme.md page

Subfolder Examples.files/output.from.ViClust.2.Matrix contains 3 output genotypes files from the ViClust.2.Matrix.R program (see details inside program) and the corresponding snp.list.txt file
