Folder Sequenom.plots contains examples of sequenom output plots. Here a subset list of SNP1 to SNP5 from the ViClust.example.xml raw data file is used.
The SNPs list example is called SNPlist.example.txt and is an argument/option when running the program (see R scripts for more details)

Folder Filter1.plots contains the SNP plots after an eventual additional filter on signal magnitude has been applied from the original Sequenom results

Folder Hclust.plots contains the plots of the clustering performed after applying the Hierarchical Clustering method with the Ward algorithm

Folder resfile contains result files described in the main readme.md page
